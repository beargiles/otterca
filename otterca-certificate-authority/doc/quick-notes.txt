Quick notes on the implementation.

1. The CA keys are maintained in a dedicated KeyStore. They should not
   be commingled with certs maintained in the repository.
   
2. The policy specifies what permissions are allowed on certificate it
   signs. Each CA key has a single policy but each policy can have multiple
   CA keys.
   
3. There needs to be a way to create and retire CA keys. Or it could be
   handled outside of the application.
